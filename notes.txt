"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "webpack serve",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
},

the code above is included as field in the package-json file.

each item in the script object corresponds to a script that is ran is its corresponding value

READ THIS!!!!!!!!  To understand how the script portion of package.json works.
ex: npm run test -> executes -> "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
ex: npm run start (run is optional, start is special in that way) -> executes -> webpack serve
ex: npm run test -> executes -> "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && webpack --mode production


VITE INFORMATION
after you migrate to vite, you're going to notice that a lot of the configuration in the vite.config.js abstracts away much of the old means of configuration
found in webpack.config.js. We'll talk more about this in the paragraph below but for now lets also highlight how the scripting for running the server found 
in package.json changes too. now there is no (npm run start) commmand, it isreplaced with (npm run dev) which triggers the (vite) command. before it was (npm run start) 
, (run is optional) triggering the webpack serve command.

HOW VITE ABSTRACTS OR SIMPLIFIES THE CONFIGURATION OF WEBPACK
there is a bunch of aspects about webpacks configuration that is greatly simplified with vites style of configuration
1. no need to include loaders for certain file types, supported natively by vite
2. simplified code specification to include plugins
3. automatic server and hot reload setup
4. entry points are assumed to start at the root. no need to specify path. you require an explictly named file named index.html though
5. output file specification is greatly simplified. similar to number 2.
